# JavaScript Refactoring Exercise

### Running the tests

The Jest library has been used to create the tests.

To run them you should install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

And then to run the tests:

```
npm test
```

### Code Style

The code base follows the [Google JavaScript style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html). 

[ESLint rules](./.eslintrc.json) have been configured for following the style guide.

You can check if your code follows the style guidelines by running:

```
npx eslint .
```
